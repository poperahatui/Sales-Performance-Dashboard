In this project, I acted as a Big Data Analyst Intern who was asked to analyse and create company sales reports using the data provided. From this project, I also learned a lot about Data Warehouse, Querying, Data Analysing, Data Visualisation, Data Storytelling, Dashboarding, and Datamart. And here I will create a datamart design (base table and aggregate table) and create a company sales report visualisation/dashboard.
